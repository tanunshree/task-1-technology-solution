Deloitte Technology Job Simulation – Python Task

This repository contains my solution for a Deloitte Technology Job Simulation task completed via Forage.

Task Overview
- Implemented a Python-based solution for a data transformation / processing task
- Focused on correctness, logic, and clean execution
- All provided tests pass successfully

What this demonstrates:
- Ability to understand problem statements in a professional setting
- Writing Python code that runs without errors
- Following structured requirements similar to real-world consulting tasks

Notes:
This task focuses on logic and correctness, not visual output.
The absence of plots or dashboards is intentional and aligned with the task requirements.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Standard libraries
